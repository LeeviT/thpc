Problem 1.

My MPI implementation seems to be pretty unfair. I set my program to print
the first 50 process ids it gets first from the other procs. Maybe 30 first
of them are process ids by 2-3 other, and the whole print contains maybe 5-6
different process ids. Example output:

          16
          12
          16
          12
          16
          12
          16
          12

          16
          12
          16
          12
          16
          12
          16
          12
          16
          16
          21
          12
          14
          16
          21
          14
          16
          21
          14
          16
          21
          14
          16
          21
          14
          16
          21
          14


Problem 2.

Compile as usually with MPI-featured compiler. Program prints approximate
value for pi.


Problem 3.

Compile as usually with MPI-featured compiler. Program prints approximate
value for average and variance. Source code contains a bit more comments.
