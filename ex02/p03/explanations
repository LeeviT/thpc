CPU time using 32-bit flop numbers, n = 100000000: 5.24868917 sec

CPU time using 64-bit flop numbers, n = 100000000: 6.5858160000000003 sec

CPU time using 128-bit flop numbers, n = 100000000: 223.3915460000000 sec

Longer CPU time with 64/128-bit numbers is caused by pipeline latency and
relatively small caches. Every summation depends on previous sum, so
program needs to save and get the previous sum from the memory at every
loop. Bigger numbers take of course more time to operate because pipeline
can hold limited amount of data so it must flushed and filled again and
again for just one 128-bit number.
