I compiled the program by command

$ gfortran -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec -O2 p04.f95

And compiler printed the following report:

p04.f95:14:0: note: loop vectorized
p04.f95:14:0: note: loop versioned for vectorization because of possible aliasing

CPU time using vectorization:

CPU time spent in loop   4.01270017E-02


And CPU time by compiling program with -fno-tree-vectorize flag:

CPU time spent in loop   4.26239967E-02
