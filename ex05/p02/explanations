Option -fomit-frame-pointer gives a little performance boost because it
helps computer to work better with stack. There is no basically any
difference between using -O2 flag and both, -O2 and -fomit_frame_pointer,
flag because -O2 already turns -fomit_frame_pointer on, so there's no need
to do it twice.
