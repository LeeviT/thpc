Compiling and linking:

$ mpif90 -o mpiex mpiexample.f90

Running:

mpirun -np n ./mpiex

where n=1, 2, 4, 8.


In output, message from process 2 (rank 3) seems to be always first.
After it, comes processes 7, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6. Also, reciprocal order stays the
same, even if there are less processes than 8.
