By running command e.g. 'make target1' make tries to build target1, which
needs target3. The output is following

make: Circular target2 <- target1 dependency dropped.
make: Nothing to be done for 'target1'.

So, make notices that dependency chain is circular, i.e. infinite loop,
and it cannot be executed.
