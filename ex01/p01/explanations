To define the clock frequency of my system, I used
Fortran program (source: infloop.f95), which executes infinite loop
doing some simple arithmetics to maintain frequency near 100%.

Model of my CPU is Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2540M CPU @ 2.60GHz but due to
frequency boost technology, theoretical limit for frequency is 3.30GHz.

While running infloop, cpuinfo gives values 3276.732MHz, 3262.509MHz,
3090.338MHz and 3090.301MHz for clock frequency. My CPU has only two
(the first two values) but it uses multithreading so in addition to
"real" cores there are two more "virtual" cores (the last two values).
Anyway, cpuinfo gives pretty accurate and right values for maximum clock
frequency.
