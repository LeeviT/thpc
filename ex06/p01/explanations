According to Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue_algorithm,
most eigenvalue algorithms have scaling O(n^3) in the big-oh notation, when
n is the order of the matrix.

In the picture cputimes.png blue dots are my measurements with various n
values, red curve is function f2(n)=0.1e-10*n^3 and green curve is function
f1(n)=0.1e-10*n^3.01. f1(n) is approximate interpolation for the data
points, so its (and my measurements) scaling in the big-oh notation is
O(n^3.01). That's quite close to literature values.

File eigendouble.f90 is the actual source code, runscript.sh runs the
program with various n values and prints the n values and CPU times to
plotdata file, and plot.py file is used to plot those values to
cputimes.png file.
