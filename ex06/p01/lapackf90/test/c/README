LAPACK TEST PROGRAMS

Compilation:
gfortran -o lineardouble lineardouble.c -llapack -L../../src
gfortran -o eigendouble eigendouble.c -llapack -L../../src

(NOTE: GNU Fortran compiler is used because LAPACK library is compiled
using gfortran and uses Fortran libraries that are easiest to link
with gfortran. gfortran recognizes that the source code is in C and
starts the appropriate front-end.)


Running:
./lineardouble < matrix4 
./eigendouble < matrix4
